A Repo for code to parse these from the game, then translate them to a presentable html format with colour coding and subheading organisation.

For further suggestions on attribute groupings (probably at least 3+ to be a group) feel free to get in contact via reddit (u/hansmellman) or Discord (`_mellman_`).
